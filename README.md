# Introduction to Churn Analysis
In today’s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.


## 📊 Project Objectives
Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:

- **Visualize & Analyze Customer Data** at multiple levels:
  - Demographic
  - Geographic
  - Payment & Account Information
  - Services

- **Study Churner Profile** to:
  - Identify behavioral and usage patterns
  - Highlight areas for implementing targeted marketing campaigns

- **Predict Future Churners** by:
  - Applying statistical methods and machine learning models
  - Building actionable insights for retention strategies
 
  - **Metrics Required**

  - Total Customers
  - Total Churn & Churn Rate
  - New Joiners
 
  - **STEP 1 – ETL Process in SQL Server**
  - Creating Database

    After installation, you will land on the following screen. Do remember to copy paste the server name somewhere because we will need this at a later stage. Also enable      the checkbox which says “Trust Server Certificate” and then click on Connect

    Once connected, click on NEW QUERY button at the top ribbon and then write below query. This will create a new Database named db_Churn
    CREATE DATABASE db_Churn

    **Import csv into SQL server staging table – Import Wizard**

    Right click on the newly created database in the explorer window and then go to

    **Task >> Import >> Flat file >> Browse CSV file**

    Remember to add customerId as primary key and allow nulls for all remaining columns. This is done to avoid any errors while data load. Also make sure to change the         datatype where it say Bit to Varchar(50). We are doing this because while using import wizard I faced issues with the BIT data type, however Varchar(50) works fine.

    # Add a new column in prod_Churn

1.       Churn Status = if [Customer_Status] = “Churned” then 1 else 0

2.       Change Churn Status data type to numbers

3.       Monthly Charge Range = if [Monthly_Charge] < 20 then “< 20” else if [Monthly_Charge] < 50 then “20-50” else if [Monthly_Charge] < 100 then “50-100” else “> 100”

 

# Create a New Table Reference for mapping_AgeGrp

1.       Keep only Age column and remove duplicates

2.       Age Group = if [Age] < 20 then “< 20” else if [Age] < 36 then “20 – 35” else if [Age] < 51 then “36 – 50” else “> 50”

2.       Rename Column – Attribute >> Services & Value >> Status

 

**STEP 3 – Power BI Measure**
Total Customers = Count(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])

New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = “Joined”)

**STEP 5 – Predict Customer Churn**
For predicting customer churn, we will be using a widely used Machine Learning algorithm called RANDOM FOREST.

What is Random Forest?A random forest is a machine learning algorithm that consists of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (in regression tasks) or taking the majority vote (in classification tasks) from all the trees in the forest. This ensemble approach improves the accuracy and robustness of the model by reducing the risk of overfitting compared to using a single decision tree.

 

# Data Preparation for ML model

Let us first import views in an Excel file.

o   Go to Data >> Get Data >> SQL Server Database

o   Enter the Server Name & Database name to connect to SQL Server

o   Import both vw_ChurnData & vw_JoinData

o   Save the file as Prediction_Data
